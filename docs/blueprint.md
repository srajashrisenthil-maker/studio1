## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#6B8E23), reminiscent of fields and growth, provides a natural and calming feel.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated hue similar to earthy green, creates a neutral and accessible backdrop.
- Accent color: Harvest gold (#DAA520), an analogous color to earthy green, adds contrast and highlights important elements.
- Font pairing: 'PT Sans', a modern, humanist sans-serif, provides a clean, accessible look for headlines and body text, but 'Literata' should be used for the title on each page to add slightly more classic style.
- Use simple, outline-style icons related to agriculture and markets.
- Clean, form-based layouts with clear labels and input fields for easy data entry.
- Subtle transitions for form elements to provide a smooth user experience.
